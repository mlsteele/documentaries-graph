            "summary": "...argues that documentary is familiarity recognized as 'a corpus of texts', distinguished by a function of representing reality from one or more perspectives, a corpus he characterizes in terms of several modes, akin to genres... pg 5<br /><br />The poetic mode had affinities worth the modernist aesthetic of exploring formal and conceptual associations in a medium, for instance between graphic qualities of line, movement and colour, and qualities of sound. pg 5<br /><br />The Classic expository mode, anchoring the meaning of images by the is of a 'voice-of-god' narration, often with systematic use of evidentiary editing, was established in cinematic documentary and played a major part in, for instance, a tradition of citizen education... pg 5<br /><br />The observational mode, coming to prominence in the 1960's, was facilitated by the advent of portable cameras and sound-recording equipment that made it possible to record both images and sounds of a scene directly and present them from the viewpoint of an onlooker not interfering with events, ostensibly, or imposing a master narration on them. pg 5<br /><br />The interactive mode developed especially through independent filming from the 1970's on wards, but also in journalistic television documentary. In contrast to detached narration or observation, it promotes communicative exchange between filmakers and participants through, for instance, techniques such as interview, talking heads and testimony. pg 6<br /><br />To these modes may be added that of dramatic reconstruction, using actors in a studio or on location, to represent past or present situations that cannot be otherwise documented, suggest details of experience and behavior, evoke qualities of emotion or memory, or portray and interpret evidence from a particular perspective for viewers to assess. pg 6<br /><br />Nicholas contends that documentary finds a particularly self-aware form in the reflexive mode, which draws attention to the process of filmmaking and hence the position from which meaning is being constructed, rather than creating the impression of capturing reality in an unmediated way. pg6<br /><br />PN1995.9<br />.D6<br />F57<br />2011",

            "summary": "It is often suggested that documentary has close similiarity to the newsreel...Their approach to and interpretation of that material are widely different. The essence of the documentary method lies in its dramatization of actual material. The very act of dramatization causes a film statement to be false to actuality... To be truthful within the technical limits of the camera and microphone demands description, which is the aim of the instructional film and not dramatization, which is the qualification of the documentary method. (\"Some Principles of Documentary\" - Paul Rotha) p76<br /><br />What Grierson and Rotha describe as different practices or methods ultimately refers to a difference with regard to style: the opposition between recording and creatively treating actuality, between description and dramatization, implies a distinction between downplaying the expressive possibilities of the medium on the one hand, and foregrounding them on the other. p76<br /><br />It must be remembered that industrial documentaries never appear alone. They are only a minor part of corporate films, which mostly presented the products in action rather than the production in progress. p169<br /><br />PN1995.9<br />.DP<br />F67<br />2009",

Documentary filmmakers limit themselves to extracting and arranging from what already exists rather than making up content. They may recreate what they have observed, but they do not create totally out of imagination as creators of stories can do. Though documentaries may follow a chronological time line and include&nbsp;people&nbsp;in their films, they do not employ plot or character development as standard means of organization as do&nbsp;fiction filmmakers. The form of documentary is mainly determined by subject, purpose, and approach. Usually there is no conventional&nbsp;dramatically&nbsp;progression from exposition to complication to discovery to climax to&nbsp;denouement. Documentary forms tend to be functional, varies, and looser than those of short stories, novels, or plays. often they are more like&nbsp;non-narrative&nbsp;written forms such as essays advertisements, editorials&nbsp;or poems.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style=\"background-color: white;\"><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;\"><span style=\"line-height: 16px;\"><br /></span></span></span><span style=\"background-color: white;\"><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;\"><span style=\"line-height: 16px;\">Fourth production method and technique, refer to the ways images are shot, sounds recorded, and the two edited together.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style=\"background-color: white; color: #262626; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small; line-height: 16px;\">One basic requirement of documentary is the use of nonactors (\"real people\" who \"play themselves\") rather than actors (who are cast,&nbsp;costumed, and made up to play \"roles\"). The other basic&nbsp;requirement is shooting on location (rather than on soundstages or&nbsp;studio&nbsp;back lots). in documentaries no&nbsp;sets are constructed. Lighting is usually what exists at the location, supplemented only when necessary to achieve adequate exposure, not for atmosphere or mood. Exceptions to these generalizations occur, of course; but, in general, any manipulation of images or sounds is largely confined to what is required to make the recording of them possible, or to make the result seem closer to the&nbsp;actual&nbsp;than inadequate&nbsp;technique&nbsp;might. Finally, the audience response documentary filmmakers seek to achieve is generally twofold; an aesthetic experience of some sort, on the one hand; and an effect on attitudes, possibly leading to action, on the other. Though much beauty exists in documentary filmes, it tends to be more functional, sparse and austere than the beauties offered by fictional films. Also, documentary filmmakers offers more than would be described as professional skill rather than personal style; communication rather than expression is what the documentary filmmaker is usually after... pg 1-3</span><br /><div><span style=\"background-color: white;\"><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;\"><span style=\"line-height: 16px;\"><br /></span></span></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: white;\"><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;\"><span style=\"line-height: 16px;\">PN1995.9</span></span></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: white;\"><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;\"><span style=\"line-height: 16px;\">.D6</span></span></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: white;\"><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;\"><span style=\"line-height: 16px;\">.E46</span></span></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color: white;\"><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;\"><span style=\"line-height: 16px;\">2005</span></span></span></div>",

He anticipated, and quite shrewdly addressed, the problems and paradoxes - epistemological, aesthetic, and moral - that, as subsequent practitioners were to discover inevitably attend this new, apparently more direct way of filming. Rouch understood that however \"invisible\" the man-with-the-movie-camera might make himself, and how unselfconscious the camera's subjects might appear, <b>filming is a real act performed in the real world with real consequences.</b> He understood as well that sometimes a <b>filmmaker has to forsake the passivity of a place behind the camera to provoke reality into revealing its deepest truths</b>.\" (pg. ~81)<br /><br />PN1995.9.D6.B48.1996</div>",

(2)<br /><br />Documentary is an essentially transitional medium: it carries fragments of social reality from one place or one group or one time to another, and in transporting them, translates them from a local dialect to a lingua franca. It collects the evidence of experience in the most far-flung precincts ... then it delivers these social facts to a broader public, where they can be used for a variety of ideological ends. (2)<br /><br />Although documentary production and exhibition are by no means exclusively noncommercial enterprises, the history of social documentary is impossible to imagine without the financial support of state, civic, and nonprofit[s] ... Such entities usually expect to generate cultural, political, or ideological, rather than financial, returns on their investment. (3)<br /><br />The supplementary relationship between what Grierson calls the \"documentary\" and what he refers to as the \"real\" is what gives the documentary mode in film and literature after Flaherty its ideological force. The process of documentary representation must maintain a tension between the particular and the general. The appearance (or irruption) of moments of authenticity, reality, and truth in this process is the guarantee that the film operates on democratic lines, responsible at once to the individual instance and the totality.
